# stem-project-series

### Overview and objectives

The STEM project series is focused on providing students at Manlius Pebble Hill (MPH) with a foundation of essential research skills and knowledge to empower them to help contribute towards a more sustainable and equitable future. In this program, students will have the opportunity to learn from environmental R&D professionals at the forefront of innovation in industry and academia through guest lectures and live demonstrations. 

The first iteration of the project series will focus on the critical issues of water and air quality, both of which have significant implications on climate change and public health. The students will learn a combination of the following skills and apply this knowledge to help answer industrially-relevant and sustainability-focused questions:
- Basic science theory to practice
- Real-world experimental design practices
- Software programming
- Hardware automation
- Data analysis and interpretation

Through the STEM project series, there is a long-term goal to help catalyze partnerships with environmentally-focused nonprofits seeking motivated young students to contribute to high-impact problem-solving efforts. The hope is that this project series will become an invaluable part of the MPH curriculum that helps steer students on their journey after graduation.

### Using GitHub repository

This repository is designed for students, faculty and guest lecturers to access and post background material (e.g., readings, code, data), standard operating procedures, results, and questions from each session. An intro on how to use GitHub can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrTQipWp6co). In utilizing this platform, students are also introduced to using and contributing to open-source projects and software. Lastly, the content of this repository can be readily shared externally and will be an invaluable resource for maintaining and growing this program at MPH.

### Example session from project series ([link to folder here](./example-session/))

The first guest lecture in the project series will be given by Abner Bogan, a research engineer with three years of water treatment experience working at a Canadian-based startup called [Carbonet](https://carbonet.com/). His background is in physical chemistry and he has previously worked on research projects in the fields of food safety, wood combustion and urban biodiversity.
